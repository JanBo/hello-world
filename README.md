# hello-world
My first github project

Hi there I am glad to be editing this file while drinking my coffee and looking at coffee script.

When it comes to object oriented languages SmallTalk is by far the best one, too bad it never really became popular.

Have a great day though, I know I will!

The end...

Cheers.
